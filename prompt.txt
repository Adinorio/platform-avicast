The current implementation of the Bird Census Management in the Avicast System is not following the expected structure and behavior defined in the @CONTEXT.txt. I want you to deeply analyze and identify why this part of the system is still poor and inconsistent.
You must:
1.	Deeply understand the intended purpose, role, and flow of the Bird Census Management based on the full system context provided below.
2.	Identify and explain all specific issues, inconsistencies, or missing connections (UI/UX, logic flow, data flow, integration, permissions, and architecture-wise) that cause the current bird census feature to deviate from the expected design.
3.	Provide a thorough fix plan that covers:
o	How to redesign its flow and structure to match the intended logic from @CONTEXT.txt
o	How to make it visually and functionally consistent with other features (species, site, image processing, etc.)
o	The right access levels and role-based behavior (admin, field worker, superadmin)
o	How data should correctly synchronize between site management, image processing, and report generation
4.	Give a structured, detailed proposal that shows the before vs. after (what is currently wrong and how it should work properly).
5.	Ensure your reasoning aligns perfectly with the overall Avicast architecture and maintains a clean, modular logic consistent with the rest of the system.
Be very critical, but also constructive. Your response must show that you fully understood the @CONTEXT.txt (system logic, user roles, features, and relationships) and can restore the intended design integrity of the Bird Census Management feature.
