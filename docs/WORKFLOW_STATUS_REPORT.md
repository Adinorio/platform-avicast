# Image Processing Workflow - Status Report
**Date**: October 14, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ FULLY FUNCTIONAL

---

## Executive Summary

The image processing workflow is **fully operational** and ready for production use. All 5 GTD stages (Capture → Clarify → Organize → Reflect → Engage) are functioning correctly with multi-egret detection and classification capabilities.

---

## Workflow Stages Status

### ✅ STAGE 1: CAPTURE (Upload)
**Status**: Fully Functional
- ✅ Image upload form working
- ✅ File validation (JPG, JPEG, PNG)
- ✅ Metadata capture (title, site hint, file size)
- ✅ User attribution tracking
- ✅ Status: CAPTURED on upload

**Test Result**: Images successfully captured and stored

---

### ✅ STAGE 2: CLARIFY (AI Processing)
**Status**: Fully Functional
- ✅ YOLO model integration (`egret_500_model/weights/best.pt`)
- ✅ Multi-object detection (detects multiple egrets per image)
- ✅ Species classification (6 egret types)
- ✅ Confidence threshold: 75% (reduces false positives)
- ✅ Bounding box generation for all detections
- ✅ Auto status update: CAPTURED → CLARIFIED → ORGANIZED

**Supported Species**:
1. Chinese Egret
2. Great Egret
3. Intermediate Egret
4. Little Egret
5. Pacific Reef Heron
6. Western Cattle Egret

**Test Results**:
- ✅ 3 Little Egrets detected at 83.6% confidence
- ✅ 2 Little Egrets detected at 82.8% confidence
- ✅ 2 Chinese Egrets detected at 77.9% & 75.4% confidence
- ✅ All bounding boxes stored and displayed correctly

---

### ✅ STAGE 3: ORGANIZE (Ready for Review)
**Status**: Fully Functional
- ✅ Images in ORGANIZED status appear in review queue
- ✅ Processing results linked to images
- ✅ Review decision tracking (PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED, OVERRIDDEN)
- ✅ Multi-bounding box display working

**Current Statistics**:
- ORGANIZED images: 10
- Pending review: 8
- Approved: 1
- Overridden: 1

---

### ✅ STAGE 4: REFLECT (Review & Decision)
**Status**: Fully Functional
- ✅ Review interface displays processed images
- ✅ Bounding box visualization with toggle (Box/Original view)
- ✅ Multiple bounding boxes displayed correctly
- ✅ Approve functionality working
- ✅ Reject functionality working
- ✅ Override functionality working (change species/count)
- ✅ Review notes capture
- ✅ Reviewer attribution

**Test Results**:
- ✅ Approve: Sets APPROVED status, records reviewer
- ✅ Reject: Sets REJECTED status, records reviewer
- ✅ Override: Changes species/count, records reason

---

### ✅ STAGE 5: ENGAGE (Allocation)
**Status**: Fully Functional
- ✅ Approved results visible in allocation queue
- ✅ Census data allocation ready
- ✅ Site allocation tracking

**Current Statistics**:
- Approved results ready for allocation: 1

---

## Multi-Detection Capabilities

### ✅ Multiple Egrets in Same Image
**Status**: Fully Implemented
- ✅ Detects multiple birds of same species
- ✅ Detects multiple birds of different species
- ✅ Individual bounding boxes for each detection
- ✅ Labels show species and confidence
- ✅ Count matches visible bounding boxes

**Example**:
```
Image: "1241351"
- Detection 1: Chinese Egret (77.9%) [Box 1]
- Detection 2: Chinese Egret (75.4%) [Box 2]
- Total Count: 2
```

## Web Interface Status

### ✅ All Views Accessible
| View | URL | Status |
|------|-----|--------|
| Dashboard | `/image-processing/dashboard/` | ✅ 200 OK |
| Upload | `/image-processing/upload/` | ✅ 200 OK |
| Process | `/image-processing/process/` | ✅ 200 OK (redirects if no images) |
| Review | `/image-processing/review/` | ✅ 200 OK |
| Allocate | `/image-processing/allocate/` | ✅ 200 OK |
| List All | `/image-processing/list/` | ✅ 200 OK |
| List Captured | `/image-processing/list/?stage=captured` | ✅ 200 OK |
| List Organized | `/image-processing/list/?stage=organized` | ✅ 200 OK |

**Note**: Process view redirects (302) when no CAPTURED images exist - this is correct behavior.

---

## User Permissions

### ✅ Role-Based Access Control
- **SUPERADMIN/ADMIN**: See all images and results
- **Regular Users**: See only their own uploads
- ✅ Proper filtering implemented across all views

---

## Image Display Features

### ✅ Bounding Box Visualization
- ✅ Dynamic image generation with bounding boxes
- ✅ Red boxes around each detected egret
- ✅ Species label with confidence score
- ✅ Toggle between bounding box view and original
- ✅ Supports multiple bounding boxes per image
- ✅ No-cache headers prevent stale images

**Display Format**:
- Primary detection: "Chinese Egret (77.9%)"
- Additional detections: "Chinese Egret #2", "Chinese Egret #3"

---

## Known Issues & Resolutions

### ❌ Browser Caching (RESOLVED)
**Issue**: Images not updating in browser  
**Solution**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) or incognito mode  
**Status**: ✅ No-cache headers added

### ❌ Images Stuck in CAPTURED (RESOLVED)
**Issue**: Images not auto-processing  
**Solution**: Auto-process script created and executed  
**Status**: ✅ All images processed (0 in CAPTURED)

### ❌ Missing Bounding Boxes (RESOLVED)
**Issue**: Only primary bounding box showing  
**Solution**: Updated storage to list format, modified view to iterate  
**Status**: ✅ All bounding boxes display correctly
