## 📈 Performance Optimizations

### Database Indexes
```python
# SiteSpeciesCount
indexes = [
    Index(fields=["site", "species"]),        # Unique lookup
    Index(fields=["site", "is_verified"]),    # Admin filters
    Index(fields=["species", "total_count"]), # Analytics
]

# DataChangeRequest
indexes = [
    Index(fields=["status", "requested_at"]),    # Request list
    Index(fields=["requested_by", "status"]),    # User requests
    Index(fields=["site", "status"]),            # Site requests
]
```

### Query Optimization
```python
# ✅ Efficient queries with select_related
requests = DataChangeRequest.objects.select_related(
    'site', 'census', 'requested_by', 'reviewed_by'
).order_by('-requested_at')

# ✅ Aggregation at database level
stats = {
    'total': requests.count(),
    'pending': requests.filter(status='pending').count(),
    'approved': requests.filter(status='approved').count(),
}
```

2. **Executing Requests:**
   - Only execute after approval
   - Verify data one more time before execution
   - Check Site Detail page after execution
   - Verify species counts if needed

3. **Bulk Operations:**
   - Use bulk approve for trusted field workers

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Chart not displaying
**Solution:** Check Chart.js CDN connection. Clear browser cache.

### Issue: Request execution fails
**Solution:** Check `request_data` JSON structure. Verify field names match model fields.

### Issue: Species count not updating
**Solution:** Check `CensusObservation.save()` override is working. Run `update_site_species_counts()` manually.

### Issue: Permission denied
**Solution:** Verify user role in Django admin. Check `@staff_required` decorators.

### Issue: Bulk actions not working
**Solution:** Ensure checkboxes have correct `form="bulk-form"` attribute. Check CSRF token.
